## About

This project is a visualization of sorting algorithms. It is a simple web application that allows users to visualize the sorting process of various sorting algorithms. The project was created to help students understand how sorting algorithms work.

It is also my and my friend's TUBITAK 4006 project.

### Built With
- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This project requires you to install the following Python libraries:
- matplotlib
- numpy

You may install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage
To run the project, simply run the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```
then follow the instructions on the terminal.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add more algorithms
  - [X] Bogo sort
  - [ ] Merge sort
  - [ ] Odd Even sort
  - [ ] Pancake sort
  - [ ] Shaker sort
  - [ ] Shell sort
  - [ ] Other weird algorithms
- [ ] Graphical User Interface

## Contributing
Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. And that is how I learned to code. However since this is a school project, I cannot accept any contributions. But you can fork the project and make your own version of it.
Thank you for considering contributing to the project!
